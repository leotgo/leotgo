<h3 align="left">About this page:</h3>

- This is my personal page for **hobby projects**, which are done in whatever free time I can find;
- Here you may find personal open-source projects that I'm sharing, but I am unable to provide active support for them or guarantee that they will be updated, as they are by no means my source of income!

<h3 align="left">About me:</h3>

- I'm interested in the core technology behind games, such as Game Engines and Rendering technologies;
- I'm a **tryhard**. I will do things from scratch just to learn how to do them;
- I believe that deeply understanding problems is more important than memorizing existing solutions;
- I want to develop high-quality technologies and tools that game developers can reliably depend on.
